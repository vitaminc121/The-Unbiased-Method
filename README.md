# The-Unbiased-Method
This is the supplementary for the paper 'An Unbiased Method to Approximate a Principal Estimand'
These results are only from Boruta and only using the internal data as the testing data. 
The picture named DCA-M1-500 means the results of Model 1 in simulation 1 with a sample size is 500, other pictures have the same meaning.
Results from Boruta and using the external data, and results from DT (internal testing and external testing can be seen in other branch in this file)
